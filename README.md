# Maycome [March 2020 - April 2020]

Created Maycome, a personal LocalStorage Cloud web application accessible within an Intranet using Java for Backend development, PostgreSQL for Database management, and HTML/CSS, JavaScript for Front-end.

To start the Maycome engine, navigate to the project folder and execute the command "sh startEngine.sh". The server will initiate on port 8080, and you can access the application via "localhost:8080/CCyes".

Before launching, make sure to configure the homeDirectory for the cloud storage by editing the Configuration.properties file located in the properties folder.

Please ensure that the JAVA HOME environment variables are correctly set for seamless execution.
